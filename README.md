## Data Dump Email
Command line tool for sending emails with current data attached as a JSON file.

Emails to send to are stored in `data-dump-email/emails.txt`.

Invoke the command by running in the root of this repository:
```bash
./data-dump-email/data-dump-email.sh
```
The script does not work if you invoke it from the child directory. Pull requests welcome to fix this.
